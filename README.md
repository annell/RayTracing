# RayTracing
A project about Ray Tracing.

## Source material
Follows the tutorial [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Organization
Will try to follow the tutorial, and split each commit into each segment of the guide, so its easy to go back and look at a specific step.

## Goals
- Learn about Ray Tracing.
- Port it over to compute shaders.
- Create a library of it that is reusable.
